Overview 

    The purpose of this analysis is to summarize the ride-sharing data by city type. We were tasked to summmarize the data by urban, suburban, and rural city types by using pandas and matplotlib to then visualize the data in a line graph.

Results

     Urban cities can be seen to have the highest total fares compared to the other cities.  This can be seen in the table located in the images folder. Though the table shows that urban cities did have the lowest average fares per ride, urban cities did have the highest average fare per drive, highest total driver count, and the highest total amount of rides.

     Rural cities can be seen to have the lowest total fares compared to the other cities.  This can be seen in the table located in the images folder. The table shows that rural cities did have the highest average fare per ride, but because the rural cities had the lowest average fare per driver and the least amount of drivers, their total fares were almost 1/10 of urban cities.



Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing 
any disparities among the city types

    Based on the results from this module there are three recommedations to the CEO that can be made.

        1) Make it known the cost of ridesharing in urban cities in comparison to ridesharing in suburban and rural cities. The average fare price in urban cities is the lowest out of the three cities and letting riders know this may increase the total number of fares in urban areas.

        2) Increase the number of drivers in suburban cities after April. There are 1000 less drivers in suburban areas compared to urban areas. This would allow for more fares to be collected by more drivers which would result in more revenue. Though these suburban cities start to experience a slight dip when March ends into April, you can see it quickly increases as April goes on.

        3) Research as to why total fares decrease as the year creeps towards the spring and summer months. Though the weather may play into the decrease because riders may prefer to walk in the nice weather, walking could prolong one's commute whereas using the ridesharing would speed up the commute.
